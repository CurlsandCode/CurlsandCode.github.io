Over the weekend I attented the City of Pompano Beach Civic Hackathon. This was my first hackathon.  I had no clue what to expect or if I even knew enough to particpate in a hackathon. As a career-changer coming from a non-technical background, my path to programming has been unconventional and often times intimidating. With just one year of serious programming under my belt, I feared that my inexperience would servely limit the contributions I could make to a team, if any. Luckliy that wasn't the case at all.

The event was schedule to start around 9am, but I arrived at 8:40am because I figured since I was a solo participate it'd be best to arrive early and see if there were any teams looking for extra members. I signed in and went up stairs to the meeting area, there were only 3 people there all seated around a round table right at the front of the room. The introvert in me wanted badly to go sit in a corner in the back of the room, but I force myself to get out of my confort zone and go sit at the table with the other people. I also decided that it wasn't enough to just sit at the table, I also needed to speak up and make small talk with the people there, so I did. The conversation started flowing, and more people came and filled up the table and eventually the room. The woman I choosen to sit next to and I really hit it off, so she is who I talked to the most.

As the event started, it was explained to us that the city of pompano was looking for help solving 4 major problems:

1. Where is my Inspector? Inspection in Real Time / 

Description: Build a solution that lets residents know when city inspectors will arrive?

Benefit: Bridging this gap will improve service and transparency to residents.

2. What do I need? Decision Tree

Description: Help residents/applicants to better understand what they will need when submitting or applying for permits via a decision tree structure.

Benefit: Providing transparency to applicants better prepares and improves the process for both parties.

3. Permit in Seconds? Improve Permit Turn around Times

Description: Build a solution that identifies where gaps are in expediting permits, shows a timeline and improves the time it takes for each party to move the process along in a timely, efficient and accurate manner.

Benefit: Fastest processing times

4. Vacant to Active? Identify vacant properties needing fencing. 

Description: Create a solution that lends visibility to identify all city, county, CRA, owned by investor property including owner, zoning and other property information.

Benefit: Quickly identify and respond to vacant or abandoned property that can be used for re-development.

They also gave the option of building something that solves a problem not listed. Overall all of the problems were interesting, but the 2 that stuck out to me the most were number 1 and 3. After going over the problems and schedule for the day, the organizers asked if there were any pre-formed teams ready to start, surprising no one rised their hand. So then the organizers asked if any one wanted to share approaches they had for any of the problems and then people who like that approach could join them and work on it. Only one guy had an idea, and it was a really good one. In the end we all just kind of form teams based on what problem we wanted to work on.

My team consisted of the two women I was sitting next 2 and a young man, who asked to join us. We decided to work on problem number 1.Where is my Inspector?. We had 2 hours to plan out our approach before we had to break for lunch. One of my greatest strengths is research, so while my teammates suggested ideas, I went into research mode. I search other cities in both florida and other states to see if they were having the same issue and how they approached.  Once I had gathered a bit of information on the problema nd possible solutions, I shared them with my teammates. Two cities with good solutions to this problem that I found were Sarasota and Miami, with Miami I couldn't see their solution in action, but the description of how it was solved sounded similar to the end soution we decided to pursue. 

Basically our approach to the solution was 2 applications, one for the inspector and one for the client. We wanted the inspector to be able fill out a form that sets up his appointments and route for the day  and the estimated time he would be at each location, and from there we could use the info provided in the form in google maps, waze,or a geolocating api, to map out the route, keep track of the movement of the inspector and send updates to the client application. For the client application we wanted a super simple user interface, so we only ask for the client to have their permit number to get real time updates of when to expect their inspector. 

Two of my teammates where working developers, so they took on the task of trying to figure out the apis and dataases for the inspector application, I took on the client application, and my other teammate had no technical experience at all, so she worked on our presentation powerpoint. 

We started coding after lunch and we only had about 3 hours to put our idea to code and get ready for our presentation. I was able to get a static version of the front end of the client application completed and hosted online with dummy data, but the inspector application required much more than 3 hours to turn into a working prototype, so we didnt make much headway there, even though as the clock wound down we frantically tried to. 

We ended up being the 3rd team to present, here is our presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I8YJzpSEY3ymBCJH0ItqTcDGfOFjWr-pspa7na9o4cA/edit#slide=id.p12

After all the presentations were done, the judges came back to announce the winners. My team and I were proud of what we were able to accomplished in the 5 hours we had to work, but we didnt really think we had a shot at winning, because there were so many great solutions presented. However, to our suprise not only did we win, but we took home 1st place! 

My biggest take aways from the competition are:
**1.You don't need to be an experienced coder to add value and contribute. **
Everyone in my team was able to contribute and add value despite our varying coding abilities. We all work together to convey our ideas in both techincal and non-technical terms, so that everyone knew what the end goal was and could contribute.
**2. Don't let other teams psych you out. **
There was one team there that made this big announcement about having a fully functional application hosted and ready to go, so before we started presentations my teammates felt a little discouraged because we only had a piece of what we wanted to create that was functional, however when it came time for that same team to present, they didn't actually have anything and claimed technical difficulties.

My team and I have talked about continuing to build out the application in our free time, so I'm really excited to see where this application goes and if we can get it implemented in other cities that face this same issue.
