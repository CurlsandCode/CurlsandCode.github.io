So this project proved difficult from the start, I knew combining two different languages/frameworks would be a challenge, but I had no idea it would be as hard as it was. For the majority of the program I've been getting by on windows sublinx system just fine, it wasn't until this very last project where I ran into trouble. For the life of me I couldn't get passed a watchers error that was unique to WSL. So I siwtched over to cloud 9, where things seem to work perfectly, until I ran into an https/http issue that cloud 9 had that I couldn't seem to get pass, so then I switch to a virtualbox running unbuntu, but there I ran into a gem issue that once again, I couldnt seem to get pass even with all the googling and stackoverflow advice to guide. So in a last ditch effort to move forward with this progress I deleted a bunch of stuff from my computer to make room for a windows upgrade, so that I could have access to windows insider programmer,and get WSL fixes before they are release offically. The upgrade seem to work and I was able to move forward in my project on my local machine. If all of that sounds exhausting, trust me it was, I was left with a massive headache from banging my head against the keyboard. 

For my final project I decide to go with something simple for the sake of time, I wanted something that I could make within a resonable amount time so that I could graduate before leaving South Korea. Well I didnt quite meet my goal because I leave South Korea for good tomorrow, and I'm just now finishing my app. But there is still hope to do the assessment and graduate before the end of February and avoid paying for another month. 

My final project is for the most part a random quote machine, but instead of random quotes I decided to make it a little bit more personal and unique to me and my culture. In my community you grow up hearing a lot of sayings, black proverbs if you will, so I decided to make that the focus of my app. The functions of the app are super simple, you can press a button and get a random proverb and if you like it you can press a button to tweet it. 

As simple as that sounds, I wont lie incorporating redux had me banging my head against a wall for a few day and I end up having to reach out to my good friend Stephen Mayeux, who is amazing talented self-taught software engineer and owner of amazing 1 on 1 Javascript tutoring service called The best js (https://www.thebestjs.com/). He was able to set up a google hangouts debugging session with me quickly and help diagnose where I was going wrong, which is just what I needed because I didnt feel like waiting until next Wednesday to meet one-on-one with a learn instructor. 

Overall this project definitely wasn't easy and I still have a lot of work to do to get my react and redux skills, to where I would like them to be, but I am happy with my finish product and I can't wait to do my assessment and graduate!
