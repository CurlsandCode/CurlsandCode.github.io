So today was my first day back on Learn after taking a break for 2 months due to getting Lasek eye surgery. Yep, I got lasek eye surgery here in Korea, and it was the best decision I have ever made. Life without glasses is amazing, my eyesight is still adjusting, but for the most part I have 20/20 vision and see really sharply. During my 2 months off from Flatiron I tried really hard not to let my coding skills depreciate. I didnt get everything done that Ii intended to during my break because during the first month after my eye surgery, I had a hard time looking at the screen for long periods of time, so I couldnt get much done, however I did manage to make a commit on github on most days. I also worked on my Rails project during the break, which I will talk about more in my next post. My goal going into my break was to use that time to catch up on concepts I flew through to quickly the first time around and to practice skills I hadnt used in a while. After I submit my rails app and pass my assesment I will have 2 projects and around 221 labs to finish before I graduate from Flatiron, my goal is to graduate by the end of January. Feburary 14th is my last day of work in Korea, so I'd like to ideally be done with the program and applying to jobs as soon as I go home.
